A Discord bot that will display, log and graph the status and statistics of a Minecraft server

## Quick Start
you will need the `manage server` permission to invite the bot and run these commands in the server.

- [invite the bot](https://mcstatusbot.site/invite) to your server

- add your first Minecraft server to the bot by entering the command `/create-mc-server` then fill out all required fields, take note of the id the bot returns (you might need this in the future eg adding your mc server to another discord server)

- enable message server status by entering the command `/enable-message-status` then fill out all required fields.

- enable channel status by entering the command `/enable-channel-status` then fill out all required fields, the bot will then automatically create a category and one or two voice channels depending on which option you selected.

## self hosting

want to self host this bot? which means you can ping your server faster and give the bot a custom name/avatar

check out [our guide](https://docs.mcstatusbot.site/self-hosting/) for self hosting the litebot. its this bot but only global customization and no caching and webserver which makes it super easy to setup.
